excerpt: 'Even though the cloud computing paradigm has proven benefits, it faces a serious problem that can compromise its commercial success. It concerns the lack of efficient approach for using optimally the available resources. For this, several approaches have been proposed. However, they suffer from several shortcomings. Often only one objective is taken into account, expressing all operations in terms of cost. Furthermore, business processes should be insured with elasticity and multi-tenancy mechanism while adjusting the available resources to the dynamic load distribution. The proposed approach aims to optimize two conflicting objectives, namely the number of migrations of tenants and the cost incurred using a set of resources. It allows to take into account the multi-tenancy property and the Cloud computing elasticity, and is efficient as shown by an extensive experimentation based on real data from Bonita BPM customers.'
