excerpt: 'Multitenancy is an important feature for all Everything asa Service providers like Business Process Management as a Service. Itallows to reduce the cost of the infrastructure since multiple tenantsshare the same service instances. However, tenants have dynamic work-loads. The resource they share may not be sufficient at some point intime. It may require Cloud resource (re-)configurations to ensure a givenQuality of Service. Tenants should be migrated without stopping the ser-vice from a configuration to another to meet their needs while minimiz-ing operational costs on the provider side. Live migrations reveal manychallenges: service interruption must be minimized and the impact onco-tenants should be minimal. In this paper, we investigate live tenantsmigrations duration and its effects on the migrated tenants as well asthe co-located ones. To do so, we propose a generic approach to measurethese effects for multi-tenant Software as a Service. Further, we proposea testing framework to simulate workloads, and observe the impact oflive migrations on Business Process Management Systems. The exper-imental results highlight the efficiency of our approach and show thatmigration time depends on the size of data that have to be transferredand that the effects on co-located tenants should not be neglected.'
