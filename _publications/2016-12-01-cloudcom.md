collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2016-06-01-cloud
excerpt: 'In this paper, we describe a framework that allowsto automate and repeat business process execution on differentcloud configurations. We present how and why the differentcomponents of the experimentation pipeline -like Ansible,Docker and Jenkins- have been set up, and the kind of resultswe obtained on a large set of configurations from the AWSpublic cloud. It allows us to calculate actual prices regardingthe cost of process execution, in order to compare not onlypure performance but also the economic dimension of processexecution.'
