With a keen interest in the intricacies of distributed systems, I delve into critical areas such as performance, privacy, and high-availability, particularly within large-scale systems. 
My knowledge in optimization and machine learning, coupled with my proficiency in both high and low-level development and mastery of DevOps/CloudOps techniques, fuels my pursuit in this domain. 

## Bio

Currently, I serve as a post-doctoral researcher at UCLouvain in Belgium, working within the [Cloud large scale team](https://cloudlargescale-uclouvain.github.io/) under the leadership of [Pr. Etienne Rivière](https://cloudlargescale-uclouvain.github.io/Etienne_Riviere). My work is presently funded through the [GEPICIAD](https://cloudlargescale-uclouvain.github.io/research_gepiciad) research initiative, a [Win2WAL](https://recherche.wallonie.be/win2wal) project (financed by the Wallonia region of Belgium) focused on the elastic and predictive management of containers for AI and data science.

In 2019, I earned my PhD in Computer Science from Université de Lorraine in Nancy, guided by [Pr. François Charoy](https://members.loria.fr/fcharoy/) and [Dr. Samir Youcef](https://members.loria.fr/SYoucef/). My doctoral research addressed the elasticity of BPM engines within cloud environments, a project carried out in partnership with [Bonitasoft](https://www.bonitasoft.com/), an industry leader in digital process automation. I then served as a teaching assistant (ATER) at Université de Lorraine for a year.

Prior to my doctoral studies, I spent a decade as a developer and subsequently a lead developer in business software. While engaging in my professional pursuits, I also advanced my academic studies through evening courses at CNAM Toulouse and CNAM Paris. I graduated with a Master of Engineering (specializing in modeling and optimization) in 2012 and a Master of Research (specializing in information and data processing using statistics and Machine Learning techniques) in 2013 from CNAM Paris.

## Current research interests

- Stream processing resource allocation
- Transversal computing through service meshes
- Enhancing performance, privacy, and high-availability in large-scale systems
