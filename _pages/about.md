I am interested in distributed systems, more precisely issues in performance, privacy and high-availability of large scale systems.

## Bio

I'm a French post-doc working right now in [Cloud large scale team](https://cloudlargescale-uclouvain.github.io/) of [Pr. Etienne Rivière](https://cloudlargescale-uclouvain.github.io/Etienne_Riviere) in UCLouvain, Belgium. My current funding is the [GEPICIAD](https://cloudlargescale-uclouvain.github.io/research_gepiciad) research project about elastic and predictive management of containers for IA and data science.

I graduated my PhD in Computer Science in 2019 in Université de Lorraine, Nancy, under the supervision of [Pr. François Charoy](https://members.loria.fr/fcharoy/) and Dr. Samir Youcef. The subject was about elasticity of BPM engines in the cloud ; it was an industrial collaboration with the enterprise [Bonitasoft](https://www.bonitasoft.com/). I was also a teaching assistant in Université de Lorraine for 1 year.

Before obtaining my PhD, I worked ten years as a developer and then lead developer in business software, while pursuing my studies in evening studies, in CNAM Toulouse and CNAM Paris. I graduated respectively in 2012 and 2013 a Master of Engineering (focused on modelisation and optimization), and a Master of Research (focused on AI, information and data processing) in CNAM Paris.

## Current research interests

- stream processing resource allocation
- transversal computing using service meshes
- more generally performance, privacy and high-availability of large scale systems
